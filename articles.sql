(1, 'An Easy Exercise to Improve Your Photography in 2024\r\n', '<p>Do you feel stagnant in your work? As someone who has transitioned to shooting professionally, I have found that growth within my own work has continually become more difficult. Doing this exercise helps me every time; it doesn\'t matter your skill level, and it applies to all genres of photography.</p> <p>In the small niche of YouTube landscape photographers, reviewing their photos from the year has become a tradition, and this year is no different. However, I wanted to approach it with more intention than just reminiscing. This past year, I personally challenged myself to shoot outside my comfort zones, try new things, and find images in moments when I might not have even taken my camera out previously.\r\n</p> <p>Reviewing your work, no matter your skill level, is always a really good practice. This goes a step further. Instead of reviewing recent images, pull up images you took a few years ago and really compare where your work is now to where it was not that long ago. Have things changed? Do you want them to change? Are they changing in the direction you want them to go?\r\n</p> <p>Using my work as an example, the images above were taken early on in my landscape journey. Most of these are from 2017 to 2019 and generally represent the images I thought were some of my best from that time period.\r\n</p> <p>Notice the levels of saturation, detail, and the attempt at perfecting every pixel to curate an almost dreamlike feel. The large pano of Kirkjufell is highly edited with light painting, fake shadows and dynamics, resizing of Kirkjufell, and more. You can see a full breakdown of that edit right here to see just how far I pushed it. I really enjoyed this style of editing back then. I didn\'t have the privilege to spend a lot of time in many places and found myself shooting photos only a few weeks out of the year - specifically when I was able to travel outside of Florida. Thus, the majority of my photography time was spent behind a computer, seeing how far I could push an edit.\r\n</p> <p>Looking at a few of my favorite images from this past year, you can see a large change in my work. This isn\'t to say I don\'t take images that contain saturation, large dynamics, or sunstars. I still take those, typically with less editing involved. I can\'t include everything here, but I did try to pick out the images I personally loved the most from this year. The beauty is there is no right or wrong. Maybe there are people reading this who prefer the first set of images over the second, and that\'s totally okay.\r\n</p> <p>The most important question is, do I enjoy them? I remember years ago capturing a big beautiful scene with perfect conditions and a lot of technical editing was the hit of dopamine I strived for. Those big grand scenes are what I woke up to capture. Yet this year, I remember sitting in foggy conditions with subdued light, feeling the same things. Finding patterns in a scene that took me a long time to navigate, getting them back on a computer and thinking, \"\"Wow, I actually found something in that chaos.\"\"\r\n</p> <p>The exercise here is more about reflecting on yourself and your work. What images stick out the most to you this year? Maybe it would be productive to keep working towards the images that mean the most to you. Maybe you have a set of images that you know are quality, but they aren\'t necessarily instilling any positive emotions; pay attention to these feelings. I can\'t tell you what or how you need to experience this process, but I hope these questions cause you to introspectively look within yourself as an artist to promote progress and growth.\r\n</p>\r\n', 'id_1.jpg', 1, '1', '', 'Febuary 6 , 2024', 'Febuary 7 , 2024', 0, 0),
(2, 'How I built my home photography studio\r\n', '<p>If you’re like me and live somewhere with out-of-control housing costs, finding somewhere with enough space to shoot in can be difficult, to say the least. Having built out a home studio in a major city, here’s why I did it, but also how.</p> <h3>The Journey to a Home Studio</h3> <p>This was something I had wanted to do for a while. Between headshots, creative shoots, editorials, product shoots, and more, I would often be renting studios often enough for it to be a large portion of my monthly expenses, but renting a dedicated studio space didn’t quite make sense. Enter the idea of a home studio: somewhere with enough space for most shoots, and if I had a larger studio campaign, then I would rent something. My previous apartment was too tight to do most types of shoots in, so when I moved, that was definitely a must-have. After all, the amount I would be saving in studio rentals every month would actually make up for the difference in rent, so the math quickly added up.\n</p> <h3>Main Considerations for the Studio</h3> <p>My main considerations for building out this sort of space were:\n</p> <ul> <li>Enough open space to have a backdrop either hanging or on stands.</li> <li>Ideally, not have to move furniture to utilize the space.</li> <li>High ceilings for shooting tall models.</li> <li>Room for equipment storage/ability to have stands and lights set up when not in use.</li> </ul> <p>After going through many places, many would have been workable, even if not ideal. Rather than trying to make it work for the space, I went into my search with this front of mind, so creating the environment would be rather seamless. Pun intended.\n</p> <p>After going through many places, many would have been workable, even if not ideal. Rather than trying to make it work for the space, I went into my search with this front of mind, so creating the environment would be rather seamless. Pun intended.\n</p> <h3>Finding the Perfect Space</h3> <p>I was open to either an extra bedroom that was big enough (in a major city, this is uncommon) or a living area big enough that it could function as both studio and living space at the same time. Enter where I am now, with 11-foot high ceilings, perfect for photographing models and for me being taller than average as well. The living area is a large open concept floorplan that allows for a resting 6ft backdrop to be up at all times. If needed for specific shoots, I can move some furniture and fit a full 10 ft backdrop as well. There is an abundance of natural light, even though I normally shoot with strobe. There is enough space for a small studio cart, as well as some lights and stands to be left out. It may not be an interior designer’s dream, but it works wonderfully and is something I aimed at for some time. A director’s chair off in the corner is a nice touch to the space, and it helps for whenever makeup artists are over for a project.\n</p> <h3>Lighting and Equipment</h3> <p>I will jump between strobe and constant light, using Godox AD600’s as my main lights, then going to the Generay Portabrights (similar to a 120D) for when I’m shooting motion or creating content. As I also model and my partner acts, this is a great spot to record self-tape auditions as well and therefore omits the need for a studio for that purpose too.\n</p> <p>With power outlets seemingly everywhere, yes, even in the floor, it makes power control a breeze whether powering lights, computers while tethering, steamers for clothes, etc. I also find it unobtrusive when not in use too; it sort of works with the natural vibe of an artist’s home. Even though it’s not a standalone studio, there is something about having a space that is for creativity, for working, that gets me fired up. Plus, having that space only makes me more inclined to shoot in it as there’s no budget concerns of looking for a studio, especially if it’s for a personal project. The simple added benefit, even of not having to load everything in a car, is a game changer. Trust me, if you’re considering making your own home studio, your back will thank you. No more lugging sandbags, stands, modifiers, etc., in and out of studios. I almost always have time for a pre-light before I start shooting. I will set my camera on a tripod and do a quick self-portrait or photograph an assistant, then get the lighting dialed in before the talent even shows up. Another benefit I’ve learned is living in Canada, many models would rather shoot inside during the winter (who wouldn’t), and having this space makes it so I naturally just end up shooting more because I’m consistently able to year-round without dealing with constant studio rentals in different spaces when you’re not sure what you may be getting.\n</p> <h3>Space and Environment</h3> <p>Perhaps the one downside is that it’s not the largest space, but quite honestly, it’s very similar to shooting in other medium to small-sized studios I’ve worked in anyway. There’s still enough room for a team to work and chill between shots. I didn’t want that sort of dark basement studio dungeon vibe, so the natural light does help liven it up a lot. I find creating a warm and welcoming environment makes a home studio feel less like a HOME studio and more like a studio that you happen to sleep in the other room of.\n</p> <h3>Living With Others</h3> <p>Obviously, if you live with others, this can add a level of difficulty, but expectations I find are a good thing to have set out, as well as clear communication whenever you are doing a shoot. My girlfriend and I live together, so to give her her own space, I generally found it beneficial to schedule shoots while she’s out, whether at work or otherwise.\n</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>That’s really the long and short of making your own studio, how I did it, why I did it, and some things to keep in mind if you’re curious about making your own. It has amped up my creativity in a lot of ways, and I’m definitely glad that I went for it. But if you’re a photographer on the fence about building out your own, hopefully, this will give you the perspective of someone who has done it and would do it again. If you do make your own, or have your own and are looking for ways to elevate it, I’d love to see your setups.\n</p>\n\n', 'id_2.webp', 2, '1', '', 'January 27, 2024', 'January 28, 2024', 0, 0),
(3, 'Dissecting How Social Media Algorithms Diminish Our Creativity as Photographers', '<p>Social media has undeniably dominated a major part of our lifestyle and played an even more irreplaceable role for us to express our opinions on the net. This social media domination has somewhat become both a blessing and a curse for photographers where most of their work is held hostage under the power of the scrolling algorithm. While some photographers may have taken the opportunity to market and broadcast their work to the world, it is still pretty challenging to maintain the utmost creativity and artistic integrity under the influence of the constantly evolving algorithm.</p><h3>The Main Issue With Algorithm</h3><p>As photographers, we are firsthand witnesses to the negative impact of social media algorithms. These algorithms are usually designed with the intent to curate content based on popularity, and the obvious side effect of this is obviously the hindered creative process of a photographer and discouraging creative experimentation in photography. This is because photographers have more incentive to shift their focus from creative intent to the pursuit of likes and engagement for the sake of publicity. The direct consequence of this algorithm is the homogenization of visual narratives. As the algorithm tends to favor mainstream appeal, which indirectly coerces photographers into producing visuals of a similar outlook. This will then slowly discourage individuality that was once defined as the photographer’s unique appeal. Personally, it is a rather sad paradox. The very platforms that were meant to amplify our voices have become conduits for visual monotony that threatens to erode the vibrant spectrum of photographic expression.</p><h3>A Possible Solution</h3><p>While we as photographers are constantly struggling to win over the ever-losing battle with the ever-evolving algorithm constraints, there are workaround strategies or solutions that might assist photographers to ease the entire situation. Firstly, photographers can work towards cultivating a dedicated audience that values the effort put into the artistry behind the lens. Building a community that appreciates the nuances of your work can provide a refuge from the algorithm storm for your audience and also yourself as a creator, which ultimately helps your unique vision to grow in a group of healthy communities.</p><p>Diversifying your online presence into multiple platforms and beyond mainstream social media platforms is also one of the ways to win over the algorithm. Establishing a personal website or utilizing photography-focused platforms such as Fstoppers or Flickr will provide a more controlled environment for photographers to shine. Hence, shielding your portfolio and artwork from all the algorithm interference that hides your work in favour of those trendy works.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, as photographers, our battle against the social media algorithm is an urgent call to action. Specifically, a call to preserve the diversity and individuality, which are the pillars that make our art form so profound. By resisting the algorithmic pressure and cultivating a niche community, I strongly believe that we can rekindle the flame of creativity that burns within each frame.</p><p>As we navigate through this digital terrain, one question remains suspended in the air. Can we photographers truly break ourselves free from all the algorithm shackles, or will the pursuit of likes and engagement continue to mold the narrative of visual storytelling? The answer lies in the hands of those creators capturing the world through their lens. This will be an endless open-ended debate echoing the very uncertainty that defines the evolving landscape of photography in the digital age.</p>', 'id_3.webp', 3, '1', '', 'Febuary 13, 2024', 'Febuary 13, 2024', 0, 0),

The vision you have and the work you put into realizing it are far more critical.</p><p>That\'s not to say gear doesn\'t matter, just that it\'s best used in service of something larger. That\'s why this guide doesn\'t get too deep into the weeds of megapixel counts, sensor sizes, and pixel peeping. All these cameras are capable of producing amazing images. Which one is right for you depends more on your needs than on the size of the sensor.</p><p>Still, choosing the right one can be confusing. I\'ve spent years testing dozens of cameras in all kinds of shooting scenarios to come up with what I think are the best choices for different types of photographers</p><h3>Full-Frame or APS-C?</h3><p>The internet has an obsession with sensors, megapixels, and zooming in on images to find their flaws. Here\'s the thing: If sharpness is what you want, shoot the largest format you can. But know that great photographs don\'t need to be razor-sharp from edge to edge. Few of them are.</p><p>That said, most of the cameras here have “full-frame sensors” (except the Fujifilm models, which use the APS-C sensors). There is nothing magical about this size; it just happens to be the same size as 35-mm film. This means that any lens made for a film camera can (probably) be adapted to work with the camera and produce the same field of view.</p><p>There are much smaller sensors—micro four-thirds, for example—that are capable of producing very sharp images. Future versions of this guide may include some micro four-thirds cameras, but for now, to keep things simple, I\'ve limited testing to APS-C and larger sensors.</p><h3>Best for Most People</h3><p>Sony\'s A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and the best autofocus system on the market. It\'s compact and light enough to carry all day without back strain, and the grip is comfortable. The five-axis image stabilization means you can hand-hold it in lower light, and the wide range of 4K video options make it the best all-around video-and-stills combo on this page. There are better still cameras (see the Sony A7RIV below) and better video cameras, but nothing else combines the two quite as well.</p><p>What I don\'t like about it, or any other Sony, is the labyrinthine menu system. Luckily there are enough customizable buttons that it\'s not too difficult to set things up so you never need to dive into the menus.</p><p>Specs: 33-megapixel full-frame sensor, 10 frames per second (fps), 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video, SD and Express cards</p>', 'id_4.webp', 4, '1', '', 'Febuary 15, 2024', 'Febuary 15, 2024', 0, 0),

Lignin is a byproduct of paper and pulp production.</p><p>Prof Maurice Collins, from UL’s School of Engineering, supervised the study.</p><p>“Despite its potential, utilising low-grade thermal energy in energy harvesting applications has been challenging due to the lack of cost-effective technologies,” Collins said.</p><p>“While there is still room for further development in heat-to-electricity conversion applications, the study demonstrates that abundantly available lignin can successfully contribute to low-grade thermal energy harvesting, especially in scenarios where sustainability and cost-effectiveness are crucial.”</p><p>Collins is a professor of materials science and principal investigator at the Bernal Institute. He is a funded investigator at the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research (AMBER) Centre and challenge lead in the SFI BiOrbic Centre. Here, he gives us an insight into his research.</p><h3>Tell us about your current research.</h3><p>The current focus of my research is on sustainable composite materials for multiple advanced applications such as energy storage, energy generation, biomedical and structural applications. With specific interest on sustainable carbon materials derived from lignin-based materials as lignin is currently an underutilised byproduct from the paper and pulp industry which is in great need of valorisation. We investigate the structure, property and processing relationships of these materials.</p><h3>In your opinion, why is your research important?</h3><p>The research is of great importance as it ties directly to the UN sustainable development goals as well as the EU’s 2030 climate and energy framework and the European Green Deal’s aims to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. We apply life cycle and techno-economic models to predict the future impact of our research and we are aiming for 50pc cost reductions and 75pc reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><h3>What inspired you to become a researcher?</h3><p>During my co-op placement I was exposed to a research environment within a company, and I continued to work with the company as part of my final-year project. After graduating I undertook a research MSc with a company and from there, I caught the bug for research and continued to pursue a PhD at UL.</p><h3>What are some of the biggest challenges or misconceptions you face as a researcher in your field?</h3><p>The biggest misconception is that I spend all my time in the lab or teaching when in reality it is a mixture of the two and more.  A typical day involves meetings with my research team, keeping on top of my very demanding inbox and planning my activity for the day. Some days involve lecturing, meeting final-year students who work in my lab, writing grant applications and papers, along with dealing with health and safety, lab equipment maintenance and purchase, and dealing with intellectual property and human resource issues. Getting to the lab is often a challenge, especially during term.</p><h3>Do you think public engagement with science and data has changed in recent years?</h3><p>Since Covid-19, I think researchers have become more aware about getting an evidence-based message across to the public. It has become even more evident how important it is that we take time out of our busy schedules to communicate scientific evidence in a clear and digestible manner. In Ireland, we have a scientifically literate society that appreciates the work of our researchers.</p><h3>How do you encourage engagement with your own work?</h3><p>I strongly encourage my team to give lectures, enter competitions like Thesis in 3 and engage with social (X, LinkedIn) and traditional media. We have had several news articles released and radio appearance over the last few years.

(9, 'Why IPv6 is the future of the internet', '<h3>RETN’s Tony O’Sullivan explains the benefits for companies of switching to IPv6 sooner rather than later.</h3><p>By the end of 2024, it’s projected there will be 207bn connected devices globally. Despite ongoing exponential growth in devices and traffic volumes, internet usage and adoption are not unproblematic across the board – it’s easy to forget that the infrastructure supporting the internet’s use comprises an interconnected web of disparate networks, all of which rely on complex protocols to run smoothly and communicate with one another.</p><p>The latest of these protocols, named IPv6, was developed and formalised in the late 1990s as a replacement for its predecessor, IPv4. It was seen as an answer to the easily foreseeable problem of ‘IP address exhaustion’ since IPv4 was developed at a time when the true scale of the global internet could not have been predicted and 4bn possible addresses were considered sufficient.</p><p>Shockingly, despite IPv4 reaching full capacity in 2010, it continues to not only co-exist with IPv6, but outweigh its use – IPv6 adoption is at just above 40pc despite the myriad benefits it offers. While the issue doesn’t present an existential threat to the internet, those that bury their heads in the sand today are missing an open goal and risk real problems later.</p><h3>Why adoption is needed now</h3><p>One of the unfortunate side effects of slow IPv6 adoption is that it results in inflation of the price of IPv4 address space. By some estimates, this has skyrocketed from $6 to nearly $60 per IP address in the last ten years, creating an artificial sense of value around a protocol that is no longer fit for purpose. This has led to shady business in the black market and increased the risk of fraud and other illegal activities to get around IPv4’s limitations.</p><p>This, of course, isn’t to say that the reason to increase adoption is to avoid the negatives of IPv4. Whilst this is a benefit, it’s important to emphasise the flip side, namely that the IPv6 protocol carries with it many advantages from which organisations of all sizes and shapes can benefit.</p><p>For example, IPv6 allows for more efficient routing without fragmenting packets, a longer life for network equipment due to better summarisation, lower latency, easier set-up and maintenance, and greater cost-efficiency and performance. Add to these a far larger address space and capacity, improved security, and better network auto-configuration capabilities, and it quickly becomes clear why organisations need to be sitting up and taking notice.</p><p>More broadly, IPv6 adoption is needed alongside other modernisation initiatives at a crucial time for the internet, which faces the urgent need for a more scalable, secure and efficient networking infrastructure. In the same way that you would maintain a car by scheduling regular servicing appointments, businesses need to understand and act on the fact that times have changed, and a new era is upon us.</p><h3>How governments can lead the charge</h3><p>Clearly, IPv6 adoption is a global issue that requires international cooperation. In fact, the full benefits touched on above simply cannot be realised without collaboration across the board.</p><p>Although pick-up in some regions, such as smaller Asian countries, is slower than average, we have already seen some nations take up a leading role in the transition. For example, the Czech Republic has set a mandatory time frame for the switch over and has committed to stop providing its services over IPv4 on 6 June 2032.</p><p>Simply put, governments across the globe have a golden opportunity to follow in the footsteps of those leading the charge by incentivising adoption. Much like the widely publicised PSTN switch-off and sunsetting of 2G and 3G networks in the telecoms world, the IPv6 transition should be seen as a non-negotiable next step to usher in the future of the internet. Several nations have been ‘talking the talk’ in recent years, but it’s time for more to ‘walk the walk’ on digital transformation with similar commitments.</p>', 'id_9.jpg', 9, '2', '', 'March 11, 2024', 'March 11, 2024', 0, 0),
(10, 'How tech can resuscitate the NHS', '<h3>Medtronic’s George Murgatroyd argues that upgrading outdated hospital tech will free up surgeons to focus more time on what really matters – caring for patients.</h3><p>Scroll through your newsfeed, and every other headline covers a new way in which technology will change the world, from transport to entertainment to communication. But in healthcare, digital technology hasn’t even reached the 21st century.</p><p>Away from work, surgeons can access smart technology at their fingertips. In the hospital or the operating room, however, they still face outdated practices like fax, pagers and DVD recordings of operations. This is a growing crisis: a survey of 300 UK surgeons revealed 80pc believe that technological inefficiencies impede their ability to perform life-saving procedures.</p><p>Outdated, disconnected technology in the operating theatre means medical teams are forced to waste time on tasks that could be automated. Given the immense resourcing challenges that healthcare systems around the world face today, that time could – and should – be better spent on upskilling and training to improve patient care.</p><h3>A barrier to better care</h3><p>According to Medtronic’s State of Surgery in the UK report from last year, a surgeon in the UK loses on average about four hours per week due to inefficient technology. That’s a full month of work each year. And within this time, surgeons can spend an average of three hours a week uploading, analysing or searching for a specific surgical video. Limited options for accessing surgical videos presents one of the biggest blockers to efficient care. However, this issue is also one of the most solvable.</p><p>The ability to watch experienced surgeons’ case studies, or watch them operate in real time, is far more complex than it needs to be. While the public can remotely access live content with ease – from a governmental hearing to an influencer’s latest Instagram Live – trainee surgeons are stuck with obstructed views in crowded operating rooms or an old collection of DVDs and USBs.</p><p>The DVD is a relic of the past for many. In surgery, it’s still commonplace. It’s clearly unacceptable that surgeons’ ability to record, access and navigate training material still uses technology we relied on 20 years ago.</p><h3>Save time, save lives</h3><p>Upgrading and simplifying the way surgeons access their own case videos can make learning and development opportunities far more accessible and offer up more rapidly available, objective data to help coach and improve performance.</p><p>Healthcare providers need to do away with outdated methods like tapes and memory sticks, and provide new tools for medical staff. From apps which offer easy-access simulations to cloud-based libraries of surgical content to live-streaming options for video and audio from an operating theatre on one side of the world to another, new technology will have an immediate, positive impact on patient care and surgeons’ careers.</p><p>Getting this right would allow trainee surgeons to be tutored by experts from all over the world, raising the bar for performance on a global scale.</p><p>Surgeons can also improve their ability to conduct post-surgery analysis. In the same way as a professional athlete analyses their performance after a match, this is crucial for gaining valuable insights and improving performance – not to mention the value of explaining to a patient in clear terms what has taken place during a procedure, and what needs to happen next. Meanwhile, tools such as advanced encryption, and ‘auto-redact’ technology will help to maintain patient confidentiality.</p><p>A modern ecosystem of surgical content will also smooth the way to ultimately implementing AI technology into procedures. Surgeons will increasingly work with AI, so it’s essential that they’re provided with the latest tools and technologies to boost their readiness for the developments of the next ten years, rather than languishing in the previous twenty.</p>', 'id_10.jpeg', 10, '2', '', 'March 7, 2024', 'March 7, 2024', 0, 0),

Mike Gallagher and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, is aimed to “address national security concerns posed by Chinese ownership of the app”.</p><p>Which remains a point of contention, given that TikTok is owned by Chinese multi-national ByteDance, and as such, is beholden to China’s contentious cybersecurity laws, which, among other elements, include provisions that could technically compel TikTok to provide U.S. user data to the CCP on request.</p><p>To be clear, no such request has ever been reported, and TikTok has long maintained that it remains separate from its Chinese ownership. Yet, at the same time, various reports have continued to raise concerns, including a recent update which found that U.S. user data is still being routed to China in some cases, and that ByteDance has many former and current CCP staffers in its ranks.</p><p>In essence, a direct link between TikTok and the Chinese Government is fairly clear, though that still doesn’t necessarily mean that TikTok is being influenced or utilized by CCP officials in any way. But that concern is enough to maintain tensions among various cybersecurity and government officials, who continue to raise the specter of CCP interference at regular intervals.</p><p>Which may be right, and given broader geopolitical movements, there could be logical reason to ban the app, or force a more definitive disconnect between TikTok and its homeland. And at the same time, you can be assured that lobbyists representing American social apps are also looking to prompt action whenever they can.</p><p>So will TikTok actually be banned?</p><p>My personal contention is that the U.S. Government remains hesitant to take any further action against TikTok due to fears of retaliatory action that could impact other elements of U.S.-China trade. The Chinese Government would not take the banning of a Chinese company from operating in the U.S. lightly, and until there’s a more definitive reason for concern, it does seem like the U.S. Government is happy to reserve judgment on the app.</p>', 'id_12.webp', 11, '3', '', 'March 5, 2024', 'March 5, 2024', 0, 0),

(21, 'Advanced AI May Be Coming Soon: What Can We Do?', '<p>McKee begins by discussing the speed at which AI is advancing and gives some examples of cases where we underestimated how quickly new technology would disseminate.</p><p>The airplane is a great example. In October 1903, an article in the New York Times predicted a flying machine might be one million to ten million years away. Two months later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first successful airplane flight. Just 66 years later, in 1969, the Concorde made its first supersonic flight. Being caught off-guard by technological progress wasn\'t limited to outside commentators. Even Wilbur Wright, who co-created flight in 1903, highly underestimated progress, saying, “I confess that in 1901, I said to my brother Orville that man would not fly for 50 years.”</p><p>In less than a century, we went from people predicting that we wouldn’t have flight for a million years to having planes that could fly faster than the speed of sound: an incredible rate of progress. It is hard to make an exact comparison between progress in flight and AI, but by any metric, AI is progressing extremely fast. Many experts and forecasting platforms estimate that we will have human-level AI within the next few decades, if not sooner. The chart below from Our World In Data gives a good sense of the speed of current progress.</p><p>In many domains, we have had huge improvements in performance in relatively short periods of time. In just a few years, we have gone from AI performing worse than humans on many benchmarks to significantly outperforming humans. If you have been following the news, you will be aware that these changes are showing no sign of slowing down—tools such as OpenAI’s SORA continue to demonstrate new breakthroughs in performance.</p><h3>AI may change our lives more than we can conceive.</h3><p>The book discusses that one of the biggest implications of advanced AI is that it will change our lives in ways that we can\'t even imagine. McKee gives some really excellent examples of how science and technology have had a dramatic impact on our lives.</p><p>Consider music. In the 1860s, most people would have had no idea what you were talking about if you asked them to listen to recorded music. It would have been an incredible, inconceivable luxury to have music available at all times, let alone to be getting recommendations, or able to share it easily with friends. Of course, this is also true of almost everything we have and do now; technologies such as Wi-Fi, transistors, corrective lenses, computers, and mobile phones were always possible with existing material but not conceived or achieved until very recently.</p><p>Additionally, there have always been big changes in one time period that would have been inconceivable to those from an earlier time. Our societies today are quite exceptional by historical standards. This is mostly because of the Industrial Revolution. If you lived any time before this, you would have had a very different expectation of life and probably no sense of what might have been possible. Having machines work for us was clearly an incredible change, and AI may well be similarly transformative.</p><h3>There is a very significant risk that AI will change our lives to be worse.</h3><p>Having established that advanced AI may come soon and is likely to change our lives, the book then makes a convincing argument that we shouldn’t assume that the changes from AI will be positive.</p><p>Many if not most of those who work on AI are worried about how it could harm us. Incredibly, before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman once said, “AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.” To my knowledge, this is the first time at the forefront of developing a new technology has stated that the same technology will probably end the world! \"\"Stranger than fiction\"\" seems an appropriate term here.</p>', 'id_21.jpg', 20, '5', '', 'March 12, 2024', 'March 12, 2024', 0, 0),

Concepts like sustainability and corporate social responsibility have gained prominence as societies grapple with complex global challenges. The concept of responsibility evolves to meet the shifting demands of society.</p><h3>Responsibility: Stress or freedom?</h3><p>Throughout history, many people have associated responsibility with the weight of expectations and obligations in their personal and professional lives. Consequently, this negative perception led to stress, anxiety, and resistance to taking on responsibilities. In contemporary times, as we deepen our spiritual understanding and society places greater emphasis on our inner lives, personal development, and engagement in spiritual and self-improvement practices, we are arriving at a novel perspective on responsibility.</p><p>“Shifting from perceiving responsibility as a burden to viewing it as a tool for self-empowerment is the key to achieving anything you want in life. Full responsibility is being the creator of your reality,” says Nina Verkoeyen, a former psychologist and the founder of Meta Spirituality, a modern spiritual movement that challenges conventional thinking by asserting that we are not merely observers of our lives but the very architects of our reality.</p><p>“Total responsibility means taking full ownership of our thoughts, emotions, actions, and outcomes. It means refraining from blaming external factors, circumstances, or other people for our challenges or misfortunes. Instead, it encourages us to recognize that, as creators of our reality, we have the power to change it.”</p><p>In the Golden Age of Victimhood, this is a powerful and much-needed message. In my book Falling to Grace: The Art and Science of Redemption, I outline the steps needed to recover from massive blows to your identity and soul. And the key one is acceptance of a situation and your responsibility to acknowledge both your role in the creation of the situation and as the only one who can move forward and adapt.</p>', 'id_22.jpg', 21, '5', '', 'March 11, 2024', 'March 11, 2024', 0, 0),
(23, 'How Our Bodies Work in Rhythm', '<p>Rhythm. It is the most important element in music. It is the foundation of all music and is essential for creating structure and movement. Rhythm is the magic that holds the music together, the heartbeat that keeps the body of a song alive. And, even though it pains me to say it (being a guitarist), the drummer is the most important part of the band. Why? The drummer keeps the rhythm. When the rhythm is off, well, there is no way to recover.</p><p>Music and rhythm are rooted in every known culture. What parent does not use rhythmic rocking to soothe a crying baby? The repetitive sounds and silences that comprise rhythmic patterns make dancing possible, aid in memory, and facilitate group singing, playing, or drumming.</p><p>Rhythm has been used for millennia to tie societal members together. The chants of a religious order or the cadence calls of military ranks are just two examples. And there’s poetry and verse, the rhythm of language, circadian rhythms in sleep, and the rhythmic changes of the seasons.</p><h3>Music Therapy Works in a Hospital Setting</h3><p>Our bodies work \"\"in rhythm.\"\" We walk in rhythm, we breathe in rhythm, and our heart beats in rhythm. And just like in music, if the rhythm is off, everything is off. One of the main reasons music therapy helps patients in a hospital setting is rhythm.</p><p>Then there’s \"\"entrainment.\"\" Entrainment occurs when body rhythms synchronize with the music to produce a desired response. It’s like walking through Target, and Stayin’ Alive is playing overhead. Without realizing it, you soon walk in sync with the rhythm. (You may even feel a little like Tony Manero walking through Manhattan on a Saturday night.)</p><p>A music therapist may use entrainment and rhythm to work on gait issues with a Parkinson’s patient. After assessing and finding the right tempo and song, the patient may soon walk more steadily with the music, entraining to the rhythm. (And, perhaps, also feeling a little like Tony Manero.)</p><p>I do a lot of work in critical care in the hospitals where I work as a music therapist. And I work with patients on mechanical ventilation, using music to help reduce their anxiety and pain. Since the patient on the vent cannot speak (because of the breathing tube inserted in their windpipe.), how can we tell if they are anxious? We can look at the rhythms of the body.</p><p>One indication may be their heart rate. If their heart rate is high, something over 100 bpm, that may be an indication of anxiety or pain. (There are also scales and tools that critical care nurses use to assess pain and anxiety in vented patients.) One way to help reduce their anxiety and pain is to give them more medications.</p>', 'id_23.jpg', 22, '5', '', 'March 12, 2024', 'March 12, 2024', 0, 0),
(24, 'The Link Between Teen Drug Overdose and Social Media', '<p>Despite an overall decrease in drug use among teens compared to prior years, one startling trend accelerated – drug overdose deaths. According to the latest available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 died of a drug overdose every week in 2022, a rate more than double that of 2019. Now the 3rd leading cause of pediatric deaths behind firearm-related injuries and motor vehicle collisions, drug overdoses in teens are driven largely by fentanyl, which has been implicated in 75% of adolescent overdose fatalities.</p><p>Why is this happening?</p><ul><li>Fake pills resembling some of the most common prescription drugs that adolescents experiment with (e.g., prescription painkillers like oxycodone and benzodiazepines such as xanax) are increasingly being laced with fentanyl.</li><li>Fentanyl is a highly potent opioid that can be lethal in very small quantities, especially for young people.</li><li>Teens may be unaware of the rise in fake and deadly pills that are being sold on the streets.</li><li>Accessing illicit – and potentially lethal – substances is easy for teens on social media</li></ul><p>How do you know if a young person whom you know or love is at risk? Studies have shown that there are three particularly vulnerable groups of young people:</p><ul><li>Teens who are not addicted to opioids but are experimenting with substances. They can end up unknowingly ingesting fake prescription drugs containing fentanyl.</li><li>Teens who have mental health difficulties and are seeking substances as a way of self-medicating their symptoms.</li><li>Adolescents who already have opioid addiction and are knowingly using opioids.</li></ul><h3>Steps You Can Take to Prevent Youth Overdose</h3><ul><li>Talk to your loved one about the risks associated with counterfeit pills and fentanyl. Avoid using fear tactics, but instead equip them with knowledge from valid sources such as the Drug Enforcement Agency, and empower them to use this knowledge combined with their best judgment to stay safe.</li><li>If you know a young person who is using drugs, advise them to: (1) carry Narcan and keep it in places where they spend most of their time, and (2) never use drugs alone, given the risk of overdose.</li><li>Since young people who overdose frequently get access to pills over social media, familiarize yourself with the emoji codes for buying and selling drugs.</li></ul>', 'id_24.jpg', 23, '5', '', 'March 12, 2024', 'March 12, 2024', 0, 0),
(25, 'The Recipe for Being Happy at Work', '<p>Research in psychology has identified several core needs that pertain to humans generally, and how these needs can be satisfied or thwarted in the workplace. Unfortunately, simply identifying what people want and need at work doesn’t automatically translate into a healthy work setting, for several reasons. Sometimes an individual’s attempts to meet their unique needs are disruptive to the group. Many times the structure, history, and goals of the organization are at odds with providing an ideal context in which people can work. And any time people come together on a regular basis, group dynamics can get in the way of optimal work conditions.</p><p>So what is the value in articulating a recipe for work satisfaction? Well, without such a recipe the likelihood of making progress toward the ideal is much less likely. Also, the recipe can serve as a guide for evaluating a work setting, and deciding whether you want to join (or stay). Last, knowing the recipe empowers you to possibly create ways to meet at least some of the core needs for yourself, and perhaps even your coworkers.</p><h3>1. Meaning and Purpose</h3><p>Satisfying work is purposeful; it makes a difference. It doesn’t have to be world-changing in impact, but it’s necessary and contributes to some larger goal. Ideally, your work clearly makes a difference to someone somewhere. However, many of us work in specialized areas within large organizations. In those cases, it is important to be able to identify how what you do at work fits within the larger context, and the value of what you do as a contribution to the end goals that are meaningful.</p><h3>2. Respect and Fairness</h3><p>In a satisfying work setting, everyone feels respected as an individual and believes that everyone is treated fairly. That doesn’t mean that everyone has to like each other, or even get along, but there isn’t the perception that some people are put down or treated unequally. As a result, people feel safe being themselves. A key ingredient of an unhealthy workplace is the experience of a blame culture, which I wrote about here, or the perception that some people are treated differently because they are either scapegoats or “favorites” of management, or the group as a whole.</p><h3>3. Autonomy and Choice</h3><p>Generally we prefer more rather than less choice and control over what we do and how we do it. In fact, humans tend to actively resist encroachment on their autonomy. So, a great way to discourage people is to insist that they have to do something, specifying when and how it has to be done in a rigid, limited way. Depending on the work, such specification may be necessary. In that case, it’s important to emphasize that the rigidity is necessary because of the nature of the work or final product, and not simply because of a supervisor’s needs for power or control. Ideally, workers are given as much latitude as possible as to when and how their work is done.</p><h3>4. Camaraderie and Teamwork</h3><p>Humans are social creatures, and working in a socially supportive setting is important for work satisfaction. Ideally you like the people with whom you work, share some degree of affinity or fellowship, and the group functions well as a cohesive team with a shared identity and mission. The antithesis of camaraderie and teamwork is the formation of cliques and widespread gossip, which I wrote about here.</p><h3>5. Improvement Focus</h3><p>People performing meaningful work want to do a good job. So, a satisfying work setting includes a shared focus on excellence and continued improvement. Ideally, everyone on the team is invested in doing their best, and helping each other develop professionally. So, candid constructive feedback is the norm, and is provided and received comfortably and appreciated.</p><h3>6. Recognition</h3><p>We need to be “seen” as individuals, and in a satisfying work environment, people feel valued as individuals. Each person’s contributions are recognized by management and the group as a whole. In a healthy work culture, excellence and successes are openly celebrated and rewarded.</p><h3>In Closing</h3><p>It’s easy to see how particular aspects of the most satisfying work settings are dependent on each other, and synergistically result in a happy, healthy workplace. For example, respect and fairness are prerequisites for camaraderie and teamwork. And an improvement focus and recognition are ingredients that enhance each other.</p>', 'id_25.jpg', 24, '5', '', 'March 12, 2024', 'March 12, 2024', 0, 0);
